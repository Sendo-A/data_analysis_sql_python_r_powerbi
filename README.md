- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Initial steps involve cleaning and preprocessing the raw dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive into the dataset using statistical and visual methods to understand its characteristics, identify trends, and uncover potential correlations.

- Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset by creating new features or transforming existing ones, contributing to the overall quality of the analysis.

- SQL Queries: Leverage SQL queries to extract targeted information from the dataset, enabling a more in-depth analysis and facilitating integration with relational databases.

- Python Scripts: Utilize Python for data manipulation, analysis, and, if applicable, machine learning modeling. Scripts are included to automate and streamline various aspects of the analysis.

- Power BI Visualizations: Create interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI, allowing for a dynamic exploration of the data and the communication of key findings.

## Data Analysis Steps

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Standardize data formats and units for consistency.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate descriptive statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation.
Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand data distribution and relationships.

- Feature Engineering:

Create new features based on domain knowledge or insights gained during EDA.
Transform variables to better fit the assumptions of the analysis.

- SQL Queries for Data Extraction:

Use SQL queries to extract relevant subsets of data for specific analysis purposes.
Join tables if necessary for a more comprehensive view of the data.

- Python Analysis and Modeling:

Apply statistical analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends.
If applicable, develop machine learning models to make predictions or classifications.
Power BI Visualizations:

- Import the cleaned and processed data into Power BI.

Create interactive dashboards and reports to present key findings visually.
